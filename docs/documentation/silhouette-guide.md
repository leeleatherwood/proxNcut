# Silhouette Integration Guide

proxNcut provides native, first-class support for Silhouette cutting machines (Cameo, Portrait) via **DXF** export and **Type 1 Registration Marks**.

## The Challenge
Cutting machines are precise, but printers are not. To cut accurately around a printed image, the machine uses an optical sensor to scan "Registration Marks" printed on the page. It then adjusts its coordinate system to match the actual print.

## How It Works in proxNcut

### 1. Registration Marks
We use **Type 1 (Cameo/Portrait)** registration marks.
- **Top-Left**: A filled square.
- **Top-Right**: A bracket pointing down-left.
- **Bottom-Left**: A bracket pointing up-right.

**Crucial:** proxNcut does *not* rely on Silhouette Studio to generate these marks. We render them directly onto the PDF. This ensures that the "Cut File" (DXF) and the "Print File" (PDF) share the exact same coordinate origin.

### 2. Coordinate System
Silhouette Studio's DXF importer uses a specific coordinate system:
- **Unit**: Millimeters (usually, though sometimes inches depending on settings).
- **Origin**: The center of the page (often), or Bottom-Left.

proxNcut standardizes on:
- **PDF Rendering**: 300 DPI, Top-Left origin.
- **DXF Export**: Millimeters, Center-of-Page origin (converted from the PDF coordinates).

### 3. Mirror Bleed
To account for slight misalignments (calibration errors), we apply a **Mirror Bleed**.
- The card image is drawn at its exact size.
- The edge pixels of the card are "mirrored" outwards by `0.5mm` to `1.0mm`.
- The cut line is generated at the exact card boundary.
- **Result**: If the blade misses by 0.5mm, it cuts through the bleed (which looks like the card border) rather than white paper.

## Silhouette Studio Setup

To use the generated files successfully:

1.  **Open Silhouette Studio**.
2.  **Page Setup**:
    *   Size: Letter or A4 (match your proxNcut setting).
    *   Registration Marks: **OFF** (Since they are already printed on the PDF).
3.  **Import DXF**:
    *   File -> Open -> Select the `.dxf` file generated by proxNcut.
    *   **Important**: Ensure "Center to Page" is enabled in Import Settings, or manually align the cut lines to the page center.
4.  **Print**:
    *   Print the PDF generated by proxNcut. **Do not scale** (Print at 100% / Actual Size).
5.  **Cut**:
    *   Load the printed page onto the mat.
    *   Send to Cut.
    *   The machine should detect the pre-printed marks (even though Studio thinks marks are off) because the cut lines are aligned relative to where the marks *would* be.

    *Note: If the machine fails to read marks because Studio thinks they are off, you may need to enable Registration Marks in Studio but adjust the Inset/Thickness to match proxNcut's defaults exactly.*

## Default Mark Dimensions
proxNcut uses these standard dimensions for marks:
- **Inset**: 0.625 inches (15.875mm)
- **Length**: 0.500 inches (12.7mm)
- **Thickness**: 0.020 inches (0.5mm)
